Hi there! I'm [naliu], a passionate developer and open-source enthusiast. I love exploring new technologies and applying them to create innovative solutions to real-world problems.

Currently, I'm a student pursuing a degree in Computer Science. My interests lie in web development, data science, and artificial intelligence. I have experience with a variety of programming languages, including Python, Java, and JavaScript.

Apart from programming, I enjoy reading books, listening to music, and playing video games. I also love contributing to open-source projects and collaborating with the developer community on Github.

Feel free to explore my Github profile and take a look at some of my projects. Let's connect and collaborate to develop some amazing software together!
